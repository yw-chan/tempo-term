 * O(kept) rows — never the whole (up to 10k-row) buffer.
 *
 * Windowing by LOGICAL lines — not raw rows — is what makes this equivalent to
 * serializing the whole buffer then trimming to `maxLines`: a fixed row window
 * holds fewer than `maxLines` logical lines whenever recent output soft-wraps,
 * which would silently shrink the retained scrollback.
 *
 * The separator is applied AFTER collecting the tail (not as an early break in
 * the backward walk), so it anchors on the FIRST/top-most occurrence — the real
 * restore boundary always sits above the live output, so a live line that merely
 * echoes the sentinel is kept as content, exactly as a full-buffer scan does.
 * Breaking the walk at the first separator it met would anchor on the BOTTOM-most
 * one and wrongly truncate at such an echo.
 *
 * One bounded-walk caveat vs a full scan: if the live session produces more than
 * `maxLines` lines AND a live line echoes the exact sentinel, the real separator
 * has scrolled above the collected window, so the strip anchors on the echo and
 * keeps a shorter (still correct) suffix. This needs the unique sentinel to be
 * emitted verbatim by the shell, so it is vanishingly rare; the alternative — a
 * full-buffer scan to locate the real separator — is the O(buffer) cost this
 * function exists to avoid.
