/**
 * @codemirror/merge defaults to `{ scanLimit: 500 }`, which abandons the
 * precise diff once a differing range passes 4,000 characters and marks the
 * whole range replaced past 16,000. That measures the wrong thing: the
 * algorithm is O(N*D) in the number of differences, so a file with a few
 * changes spread far apart is cheap to diff exactly and yet trips a limit set
 * on range size alone. A 13,890-line resource file with 24 added lines came
 * out as the entire file deleted and added back, against git's own +24 -0.
 *
 * Measured on that file (450KB): the default marks 107,763 characters as
 * deleted in 0.8ms, where an unlimited scan is exact in 11ms.
 *
 * So the budget is time, not size. 1000ms sits above the worst case worth
 * being precise about -- 500 changed lines scattered through a large file,
 * exact in ~530ms -- and a shorter deadline is not only less precise but
 * slower, because every range that misses it falls back to a crude match that
 * costs more on a wide range than finishing the scan would have (300ms
 * measured at 1653ms, against 411ms unlimited). Two genuinely unrelated large
 * files, the case the scan limit is there for, give up at ~930ms.
